      </h2>
      <p>
        CodePulse is an interactive visualizer built to help students and
        developers understand the inner workings of core Computer Science
        algorithms and data structures. With vibrant animations and real-time
        step-by-step breakdowns, CodePulse brings abstract logic to life.

        <h3>Purpose & Vision</h3>
        <p>
          As a Computer Science student, I noticed how difficult it can be to
          grasp the logic behind algorithms and data structures just through
          textbook diagrams. CodePulse was created to bridge that gap â€” a
          visual-first, interactive tool that turns static concepts into
          animated experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          My vision is to make CS education more accessible, intuitive, and
          enjoyable.
